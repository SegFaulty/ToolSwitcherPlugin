# ToolSwitcherPlugin
This plugin is a simplified version of the [Tool Switcher](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2211605465) mod. The benefits of this plugin over the mod are that you can use any toolbar page, and it will work on any multiplayer server. There is no configuration yet, so the welder, grinder, and drill will always be grouped together while this plugin is enabled.
This plugin is still a WIP.

## The Mod
You can find the mod version of this plugin [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2211605465). It has more features, but it also comes with certain limitations based on the mod api. Make sure to disable the plugin if you decide to use the mod.
